I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

What?! No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I call it luck. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. What!? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

Ye-ha! What?! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Red Five standing by. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What!?

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

I'm trying not to, kid. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I'm trying not to, kid.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

Don't underestimate the Force. I'm trying not to, kid. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. As you wish.

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? He is here. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

Don't underestimate the Force. I'm trying not to, kid. What!? You don't believe in the Force, do you?

Ye-ha! What!? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

You mean it controls your actions? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You mean it controls your actions?"$
